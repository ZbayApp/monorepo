## [2.0.0]

### Breaking changes

* To let users join when the owner is offline we made changes that broke backwards compatibility, so you will need to create a new community and re-invite members. Need help migrating? [help@quiet.chat](mailto:help@quiet.chat)

### New features

* Users can join a community when its owner is offline. This was a big one!
* Desktop and mobile users can send markdown messages. (Thanks again @josephlacey!)
* Desktop users can now export chats to a text file. (Thanks @rajdip-b!)

### Improvements

* Prettier message loading indicator on mobile
* Better descriptions of the joining process
* Validation of community metadata and certificates
* A real iOS launch screen (so long, "Powered by React Native"!)
* A nice splash screen on mobile until the joining/creating screens are ready
* Clearer autoupdate language in the update modal, so users know that the app will update on restart

### Fixes

* Mobile apps should no longer crash on restart.
* Joining community no longer gets stuck on "initiating backend modules."
* Invalid peer addresses in peer list are now filtered out, and peer list is updated in localdb.
* Peers now dial new users without having to restart.
* Up/down arrows are now working properly inside channel input. (Thanks @josephlacey!)
* Long messages are no longer truncated in channelInput component.
* Users can change between "join community" and "create community" screens without errors about a missing required field.
* On iOS, there's more weird empty space between the input field and the soft keyboard.
* The UI for users already in a community joining a new community is no longer misleading, so users will not accidentally leave a community by opening a new invite link.
* Desktop settings now open the "invite" tab by default, as they were meant to.
* We now initialize electron-store after setting appData to prevent creating an empty "Quiet" data directory.

### Notes

* Quiet now labels duplicate unregistered usernames
* Quiet shows an full-screen warning for duplicate registered usernames, since these should never happen and indicate a potential compromise.
* For authenticating connections, Quiet now uses libp2p's [Pre-shared Key Based Private Networks](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/pnet/Private-Networks-PSK-V1.md) instead of X.509 certificates so peers can connect before registering.
